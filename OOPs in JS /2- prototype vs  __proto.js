To explain let us create a function

# function a (name) {
  this.name = name;
 }
#
When JavaScript executes this code, it adds prototype property to a, prototype property is an object with two properties to it:

constructor
__proto__
So when we do

a.prototype it returns

     constructor: a  // function definition
    __proto__: Object
Now as you can see constructor is nothing but the function a itself and __proto__ points to the root level Object of JavaScript.

Let us see what happens when we use a function with new key word.

 var b = new a ('JavaScript');
When JavaScript executes this code it does 4 things:

#
It creates a new object, an empty object // {}
It creates __proto__ on b and makes it point to a.prototype so b.__proto__ === a.prototype
It executes a.prototype.constructor (which is definition of function a ) with the newly created object (created in step#1) as its context (this), hence the name property passed as 'JavaScript' (which is added to this) gets added to newly created object.
It returns newly created object in (created in step#1) so var b gets assigned to newly created object.
Now if we add a.prototype.car = "BMW" and do b.car, the output "BMW" appears.
  #

this is because when JavaScript executed this code it searched for car property on b, it did not find then JavaScript used b.__proto__ (which was made to point to 'a.prototype' in step#2) and finds car property so return "BMW".





prototype-> prototype property is created when a function is declared.Person.prototype property is created internally once you declare above function.
  Many properties can be added to the Person.prototype which are shared by Person instances created using new Person().

  __proto__ -> Every instance created using new Person() has a __proto__ property which points to the Person.prototype.
  This is the chain that is used to traverse to find a property of a particular object.
